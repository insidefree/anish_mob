*** Start the Emulator from the Command Line
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline.html

emulator -list-avds
emulator -avd avd_name
emulator -avd avd_name -gpu host -> if black screen on load
work_comp_win7: C:\Users\denys-s\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\emulator

1.Download and extract the SDK. https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
2.Open a terminal and navigate to the “tools” directory.
3.Launch the “android” tool (./android if you are currently in the tools directory).
4.Tick off the “SDK Platform” for each version of Android that you’d like to use in your emulator.
5.Click the “Install N Packages” button.
6.Click each package and tick off “Accept License” (legally, I’m probably required to tell you that this step may take several hours as you read each license ;).
7.Done with those licenses? Great. Click “Install”. Wait for the SDK manager to finish installing your packages, then you can close it.
8.Back in your terminal, still in the tools directory, enter ./android avd which will launch the Android Virtual Device Manager.
9.Click “New” and fill out the form to build the device you’d like to emulate. In the “Target” dropdown, you’ll see the SDK Platforms that you installed earlier. If the version you need is missing, you need to go back and install it. Click OK when you’re done.
10.Click on the device that you just created and click the “Start” button, tweak any options that you need on the Launch Options window, and click “Launch”.
